- both demanding intellectually
- both interesting environments, similar
- data science: less parochial in a company ; people help each other
- data science: less freedom, but still lots of freedom (work for business goals, but, at least in reasonable businesses, leaders don't tell you how to achieve those goals)
- more time on actual number crunching, less time preparing graphs for papers
- less pressure: can do real development, plan for the future

From academia to data science
=============================

It has been a hectic three months: I left a post-doc in theoretical physics at Cambridge and started working as a data architect for [SCL Elections](sclelections.com). Having never worked in industry, the jump was a little daunting: I didn't really know what to expect from my new job. Three months on, it's time to reflect on the science to data science jump.

Work
----

In academia, you are working at the frontier of human knowledge. I was worried that industry would be less intellectually stimulating, but this proved totally unfounded. Machine learning on large datasets requires just as much intelligence, creativity and intuition as theoretical physics.

I have found that I spend less time doing non-core work. In academia, you spend a lot of time tweaking graphs, cutting words because your article is too long, asking people for money or dealing with the bureaucratic monstrosities that universities have become. At SCL, I spend upwards of ninety percent of my time doing "brain work" (in my case, planning database structures and data flows, but for data scientists, this would be planning, coding and tuning models).

People
------

Academia gathers some of the best minds in the world. The ability to interact with them on a daily basis is incredible, so much so that people become blas&eacute;: "Nobel prize winners? Oh, we have one of those just down the hall!". I was concerned that the quality of my interactions at work would decrease significantly, but again, this has not been the case. There are seven data scientists at SCL, five of which have PhDs (including three from Cambridge). Data scientists come from strong quantitative backgrounds, so, chances are, you will interact with people from a very high calibre (so much so that the exodus from academia to data science is a concern among [academics](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/)).

The atmosphere at work is very different to that in a lab, though. In academia, you are on your own. Sure, you have co-workers, supervisors, PhD students. But they feel like temporary allies. Ultimately, your success is determined by the number and quality of articles that *you* publish. At work, the data team feels like a team. We work together. We share ideas freely, knowing that discussion will benefit the team as a whole. 

Recognition
-----------

This is a tricky one. Academia has a well-accepted metric for recognizing achievement: paper count and citations. In the real world, there is no clear metric of success, but that doesn't mean there is no recognition.

In industry, recognition comes in two flavours: "internal" and "external". Internal recognition comes from inside the company. Hopefully, you value your peers' opinion, and their being happy with the work you do provides a measure of recognition. External recognition is what you get outside of the company. For instance, I work on [open source projects](http://scikit-monaco.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), I [blog](www.pascalbugnion.net/blog), I occasionally speak at meet-ups, all of which lead to recognition. Basically, the absence of clear metric lets you define success in a way that suits you. 

Parting words
-------------

The academic world can be insular. It sometimes feels, when one is on the island, that it is the only "worthy" career path. What's more, taking the decision to leave is scary since it often feels that there is no turning back. I hope this post provides some measure of reassurance to people who feel that academia is not for them.
